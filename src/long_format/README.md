# long_format

This directory is reserved for legacy and future modules that operate on the long (panel) format of loan data (one row per loan per period).

- Place the original flexible data handling, long-format loaders, and advanced time series analysis here.
- Use for future use cases requiring full balance detail, delinquency, or prepayment analysis.
