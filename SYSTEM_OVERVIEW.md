4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate vintage quality based on early performance

### Seasoning Curve Modeling

The system fits three types of mathematical curves to historical seasoning patterns:

1. **Weibull Distribution**: Flexible curve for modeling seasoning patterns
   - Formula: `α * (1 - exp(-(x/β)^γ))`
   - Parameters: α (scale), β (shape), γ (shape)

2. **Lognormal Distribution**: Alternative approach for seasoning modeling
   - Formula: `α * lognorm.cdf(x, σ, scale=exp(μ))`
   - Parameters: α (scale), μ (location), σ (shape)

3. **Gompertz Curve**: S-shaped curve for gradual seasoning
   - Formula: `α * exp(-β * exp(-γ * x))`
   - Parameters: α (scale), β (shape), γ (growth rate)

### Forecasting Approach

1. **Historical Analysis**: Fit seasoning curves to historical data
2. **Vintage Quality Assessment**: Evaluate quality of new vintages
3. **Forward Projection**: Apply seasoning curves to future periods
4. **Scenario Generation**: Create multiple economic scenarios
5. **Risk Assessment**: Calculate key risk metrics
