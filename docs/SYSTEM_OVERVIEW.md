# Vintage Charge-off Forecasting System Overview

## Executive Summary

This system provides a comprehensive solution for forecasting loan charge-offs using vintage analysis and time series methods. It's specifically designed for lending institutions with long-term loans (10+ years) and analyzes historical data from 2014 onwards to provide forward-looking projections.

## Business Problem

Lending institutions need to:
- **Forecast future charge-offs** for capital planning and risk management
- **Understand vintage performance** to optimize origination strategies
- **Model seasoning patterns** to predict when loans are most likely to default
- **Conduct stress testing** under different economic scenarios
- **Meet regulatory requirements** for CECL and stress testing

## Solution Architecture

1. **Data Loader** (`src/data_loader.py`)
   - Handles historical loan performance data
   - Generates realistic sample data for demonstration
   - Supports multiple file formats (CSV, Excel, Parquet)
   - Preprocesses data for vintage analysis

2. **Vintage Analyzer** (`src/vintage_analyzer.py`)
   - Analyzes loan performance by origination period (vintage)
   - Fits mathematical seasoning curves to historical data
   - Identifies vintage quality patterns and seasonal effects
   - Calculates key vintage performance metrics

3. **Forecaster** (`src/forecaster.py`)
   - Projects future charge-offs using fitted seasoning curves
   - Generates multi-scenario forecasts
   - Calculates comprehensive risk metrics
   - Provides export capabilities for reporting

### Key Features

#### Vintage Analysis

- **Seasoning Curve Fitting**: Weibull, Lognormal, and Gompertz distributions
- **Vintage Quality Assessment**: Early performance indicators (6, 12, 18 months)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Seasonal and trend analysis

#### Forecasting Engine
- **Individual Vintage Forecasting**: Project charge-offs for specific vintages
- **Portfolio Aggregation**: Combine forecasts across entire portfolio
- **Scenario Generation**: Optimistic, base case, pessimistic, and stress scenarios
- **Risk Metrics**: Peak rates, timing, concentration measures

#### Risk Management
- **Charge-off Timing**: When charge-offs are expected to peak
- **Volatility Analysis**: Standard deviation of monthly charge-off rates
- **Concentration Risk**: Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for vintage concentration
- **Scenario Sensitivity**: Range of outcomes across economic scenarios

## Methodology

### Vintage Analysis Process

1. **Data Segmentation**: Group loans by origination period (vintage)
2. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor charge-off rates over loan life (seasoning)
3. **Pattern Identification**: Identify seasonal and trend patterns
4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate vintage quality based on early performance

### Seasoning Curve Modeling

The system fits and compares several models to historical seasoning patterns for each segment:

- **Weibull Distribution**: Flexible, interpretable, commonly used for time-to-event data
- **Lognormal Distribution**: Captures right-skewed timing of losses, interpretable
- **Gompertz Curve**: Handles saturation and deceleration, interpretable
- **Simple Linear/Polynomial Trend**: Baseline, highly explainable, but may underfit
- **Scaling Method**: Scales observed charge-off rate at a given month by the reciprocal of the typical proportion of lifetime charge-offs observed at that month (simple financial scaling)
- **Additive Method**: Adds expected future charge-off rates (from historical averages) to the current observed rate (simple additive projection)
- **(Optional) Ensemble/Weighted Average**: Combines forecasts from above models, potentially improving robustness

> **Note:** All models are fit to the time series of cumulative charge-off rates by seasoning month. No macroeconomic factors are included in the base models unless such data is available and explicitly incorporated.

#### Model Assessment and Selection

For each model, the following are evaluated:
- **Goodness-of-fit**: $R^2$, RMSE, visual fit
- **Forecast stability**: Sensitivity to outliers, overfitting risk
- **Complexity**: Number of parameters, interpretability
- **Explainability**: Can the model's behavior be easily understood and justified?

A summary table is produced for each segment, showing the performance and characteristics of each model.

| Model         | RMSE   | RÂ²     | # Params | Explainability | Notes                |
|---------------|--------|--------|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Weibull CDF   | 0.012  | 0.98   | 2        | High          | Good fit, interpretable |
| Lognormal CDF | 0.013  | 0.97   | 2        | High          | Slightly underfits tail |
| Gompertz CDF  | 0.011  | 0.98   | 2        | High          | Best fit, similar to Weibull |
| Linear Trend  | 0.025  | 0.90   | 2        | Very High     | Underfits, but simple |
| Scaling       | 0.030  | 0.88   | 1        | Very High     | Simple financial scaling |
| Additive      | 0.028  | 0.89   | 1        | Very High     | Adds future expected CO% |
| Ensemble      | 0.011  | 0.98   | 4        | Medium        | Robust, less interpretable |

- If one model is clearly superior (accuracy, parsimony, and explainability), it is selected.
- If multiple models perform similarly, an ensemble or weighted average may be used to combine their forecasts, increasing robustness and trust.
- If models disagree significantly, this is flagged for further investigation and transparency in reporting.

### Future Work

- **Macroeconomic Integration**: Incorporate macroeconomic variables (e.g., unemployment, GDP, interest rates) if/when data is available, to allow for scenario-based or macro-driven forecasting.
- **Prepayment and Recovery Modeling**: Extend models to account for prepayments and recoveries, which can impact loss timing and magnitude.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Explore more complex models (e.g., gradient boosting, neural nets) if justified by data volume and need for accuracy, with careful attention to explainability.
- **Additional Features**: If data becomes available, consider incorporating borrower-level or loan-level features that may improve forecast accuracy, such as employment status, income, or geographic region.
